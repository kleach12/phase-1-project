<h1>RATED</h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

This is a single page application that allows for a User to express their opions on a video game or share a game with other users. 

At the top of the page users are allowed to enter in the information of a game using,

<ul>
<p> Games Name</p>
<p> An Img Url</p>
<p> Price </p>
<p> The systems the game can be found on </p>
<p> A short description of the game </p>
</ul>

<p>This is not reuired and users can easily retrct the drop down button using the back button.</p>

<p>Users can then browse though a seemingly endless library of games that they, can use to determine which which game will be the nextt in their line of play or give simple feedback with the <b> Must Play, Play, Return </b> like feature.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p> In the future I would like to expnad this beyond a single page application. I believe this would be a more organized applicaiton with categorgies. I would also liek to add an upcoming feature thatt allows for Users to rate how excited or not for a game that has not been released yet. </p>
