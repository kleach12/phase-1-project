<h1>RATED</h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

This is a single page application that allows for a user to express their opinions on a video game or share a game with other users. 

At the top of the page users are allowed to enter in the information of a game using:

<ul>
<p> Games Name</p>
<p> An Img URL</p>
<p> Price </p>
<p> The systems that the game can be found on </p>
<p> A short description of the game </p>
</ul>

<p>This is not required and users can easily retract the drop down button using the back button.</p>

<p>Users can then browse through a seemingly endless library of games that they can use to determine which game will be the next in their line of play or give simple feedback with the <b> Must Play, Play, Return </b> like feature.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p> In the future, I would like to expand this beyond a single page application. I believe this would be a more organized application with categories. I would also like to add an upcoming feature that allows for users to rate how excited they are for a game that has not been released yet. </p>
